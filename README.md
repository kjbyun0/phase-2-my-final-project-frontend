# Phase 2 Final Project: Grocery App

## Project Description
This application is a simplified version of the online grocery store. You can move grocery items to my list which you can move items from my list to my cart later on or move them directly to My Cart. All the purchased items from My Cart are moved to My Storage. You can manage item counts on my storage up to date and set items as stapled items so that you can place insufficient number of items in My Cart to order.

The frontend application is developed using react and semantic ui react, and the backend application is a json-server db.
